You can write prompts with variables, like { {variable_1} }, or { {variable_2} }. You don't have to use "variable", though.

You can write anything, for example:

An image of 2 objects, { {object_1} }, and { {object_2} }. 

or

"staring up into the infinite celestial library, endless { {item_2} }, flying { {item_1} }, { {adjective_1} }, sublime, cinematic lighting, watercolor, mc escher, dark souls, bloodborne, matte painting" this is only an example, come up with new ideas, art styles, etc.

So this is the Dynamic Prompt Format.

 I want you to write {{number_of_prompts}} perfect dynamic prompts for {{category}}, which I can use to query Midjourney with one message, and include some dynamic variables where you see fit. 

You may use the following guide to help you:

{{MJ_RULES}}

Here are some examples:
"Christmas postcard, In the style of textured illustrations, satirical tone, fluid gestures, old timey, light red, gritty reportage, ultra detailed --ar 5:7"

"Valentines day post card, in the style of liam wong, vintage americana, frans hals, loose gestures, ilford xp2, red threads, tivadar csontvÃ¡ry kosztka --ar 5:7"

Only include a maximum of {{max_number_of_variables}} dynamic variables.

Format these prompts in an array of strings, like: ["prompt 1", "prompt 2"] etc.

--is-ai-prompt
--hide-item-from-list

--is-ai-prompt
ACTION: Loop
ManyItems: TRUE
ForEveryItemDoThis: This is a Midjourney prompt to generate {{category}}, so add more artistic detail to this prompt, and add " --ar 5:7" at the end of it, with a whitespace before the "--". Return the string only:
{{step_1}}
